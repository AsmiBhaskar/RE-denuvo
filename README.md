# RE-denuvo


I will now attempt to do something thats completely pointless, which is to understand how denuvo works


I'm referring to anti-piracy, anti-tamper, and digital rights management software. To explore how it works, I will attempt to create similar software using C, as its low-level capabilities offer more control than Python, and its compiled nature makes it less vulnerable to breaches compared to interpreted languages.


this is for educational purpose only (of course)

now taking a DRM server and client based approach with a offline first fallback
